### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me :

- I am quick to learn new technologies to apply them effectively in my work
- I take responsibility for the decisions I make and provide well-supported arguments for my viewpoints.

- I exhibit leadership qualities, assisting colleagues and have successful discussions with clients
